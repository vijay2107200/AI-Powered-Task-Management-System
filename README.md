## Problem Statement

Design and develop an intelligent task management system that leverages NLP and ML techniques to automatically classify, prioritize, and assign tasks to users based on their behavior, deadlines, and workloads.

## Dataset

A **synthetic task management dataset** (8,110 rows → 8,000 after cleaning) modelled on Jira/Trello exports: free-text task descriptions, category, priority, status, deadlines, effort estimates and assignee workload fields. See [docs/DATASET.md](docs/DATASET.md) for full column descriptions and design rationale.

- **Week 2 classification target:** `category` (7 classes — Bug Fix, Feature, Testing, …)
- **Week 3 priority target:** `priority` (Low / Medium / High / Critical)
- **Workload balancing signals:** `assignee_open_tasks`, `assignee_experience_years`, `estimated_hours`

## Week 1 Deliverables (complete)

| Deliverable | Location |
|---|---|
| Task dataset collected + documented | `data/raw/tasks.csv`, `docs/DATASET.md` |
| EDA & data cleaning (missing values, duplicates, inconsistent labels, visualizations) | `notebooks/01_EDA_Data_Cleaning.ipynb` |
| Cleaned dataset | `data/processed/tasks_clean.csv` |
| NLP preprocessing (lowercase, punctuation removal, tokenization, stop words, lemmatization) | `notebooks/02_NLP_Preprocessing.ipynb` |
| Preprocessed dataset | `data/processed/tasks_nlp.csv` |

### Key EDA findings

- `category` is imbalanced (Bug Fix ~28% … Research ~5%) → stratified splits needed in Week 2
- `days_to_deadline` correlates strongly (negatively) with priority — the core Week 3 signal
- Effort estimates are log-normal shaped → median imputation used
- Workload/experience fields are independent of priority → reserved for assignment logic

## How to Run

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk jupyter

# (optional) regenerate the dataset — deterministic, seed 42
python scripts/generate_task_dataset.py

# run the notebooks in order
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_EDA_Data_Cleaning.ipynb
jupyter notebook notebooks/02_NLP_Preprocessing.ipynb
```

All notebook paths are relative to the repository — no local absolute paths required.

## Roadmap

- **Week 1 — done:** dataset collection, EDA & cleaning, NLP preprocessing
- **Week 2 — done:** TF-IDF / word-embedding features; task classification with Naive Bayes & SVM; evaluation in [reports/week2_model_comparison.md](reports/week2_model_comparison.md) — see [docs/WEEK2_PLAN.md](docs/WEEK2_PLAN.md)
- **Week 3 — in progress:** priority prediction (Random Forest / XGBoost), workload-balancing logic, GridSearchCV tuning — see [docs/WEEK3_PLAN.md](docs/WEEK3_PLAN.md)
- **Week 4:** final models, dashboard mockup, performance report
